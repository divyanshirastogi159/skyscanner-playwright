Efforts to Solve CAPTCHA Issue in Skyscanner Automation

1. Introduction
During the automation of the Skyscanner website using Playwright, I encountered persistent CAPTCHA challenges that obstructed the execution of my test cases. This document outlines the approaches I employed to solve the CAPTCHA issue, the challenges faced, and the outcomes.

 2 Overview of the Problem
The CAPTCHA challenge was triggered during the execution of certain automated actions, particularly when clicking on search button which navigates to the search results page or interacting with dynamic elements on the Skyscanner site. This significantly disrupted the flow of the automation script, leading to incomplete test runs.

3. Attempted Solutions

3.1 Playwright Stealth Mode
Objective: Bypass or reduce the likelihood of CAPTCHA challenges by disguising the automation tool as a legitimate browser.
Approach:
- I integrated the `playwright-stealth` plugin, a tool designed to make the automated browser mimic human-like behavior by altering certain browser attributes that are often used to detect bots.
- The plugin modifies the browser’s fingerprints (e.g., user agent, web driver flags) and adds subtle delays to actions, which helped to partially reduce the frequency of CAPTCHA triggers.

Outcome:
- Implementing `playwright-stealth` showed some initial success in reducing the CAPTCHA appearances, allowing the automation to proceed further into the test scenario.
- However, the CAPTCHA challenges still persisted intermittently, particularly when performing repetitive or rapid actions across multiple pages.


3.2 Introducing Human-Like Delays
Objective: Mimic human browsing patterns to avoid triggering CAPTCHA.
Approach:
- I introduced various delays between actions using Playwright’s `page.waitForTimeout()` function to simulate human-like behavior.
- The delays were randomized to make the browsing pattern less predictable, avoiding uniform intervals that could be flagged as bot-like behavior.
- Specific actions such as scrolling, clicking, and typing were adjusted to include these delays, aiming to reduce the automation’s detection as a bot.

Outcome:
- The use of delays helped in simulating a more natural interaction with the website, but this did not prevent CAPTCHA challenges from appearing.
- The CAPTCHA continued to appear in some scenarios, particularly when multiple requests were made in quick succession or when navigating rapidly through search results.

4. Challenges Faced
Despite the strategies employed, completely bypassing the CAPTCHA proved to be a challenge due to the advanced detection mechanisms in place on the Skyscanner website. Some of the key challenges included:
- Limited Control Over CAPTCHA: As an external security feature, the CAPTCHA system was beyond the direct control of the automation script, limiting the effectiveness of any bypass attempts.
- Balancing Speed and Realism: Introducing delays to mimic human behavior helped to some extent but also slowed down the automation significantly, affecting overall performance.

5. Conclusion
Although significant efforts were made to bypass the CAPTCHA challenges using `playwright-stealth` and human-like delays, the issue persisted in certain scenarios. This highlights the complexity of dealing with CAPTCHA in automation tasks, especially on sites with robust anti-bot measures like Skyscanner.
Further solutions might involve exploring CAPTCHA-solving services. However, they carry significant legal and ethical risks. Bypassing them can undermine the security and integrity of the website, potentially leading to harmful consequences for both the website and its users.
I always follow an ethical approach and adhere to best practices in all my work, ensuring that my actions align with legal standards and professional integrity.
